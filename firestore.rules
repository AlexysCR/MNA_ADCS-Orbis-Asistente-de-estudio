/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for VoiceNote application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model where each user can only access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, with subcollections for voiceNotes and topicClusters.
 * - /users/{userId} : User profile data.
 * - /users/{userId}/voiceNotes/{voiceNoteId} : Voice notes for a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/topicClusters/{topicClusterId} : Topic clusters for a specific user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own data.
 * - Data consistency between the path and the document's internal userId field is enforced on create and update.
